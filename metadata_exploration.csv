Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).","Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Gene expression data were imported into Partek Genomics Suite 6.5 (Partek, St Louis, Mo) as CEL files using default parameters. Raw data were preprocessed, including background correction, normalization, and summarization using robust multiarray average analysis, and expression data were log2 transformed. Differential expression analysis for the whole blood cells was performed using 1-way ANOVA (either infection status or drug treatment alone). Gene lists were created using a cutoff of P < .05, 2-fold change, although second-level analysis using a false-discovery rate of <0.05, 2-fold change was also performed.","GPL1261","Sun Hee,,Ahn","Infectious Diseases (Staphylococcal Disease)","Medicine","Duke University","Stead Bldg, RM 1546A ","Durham","NC","27710","USA","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM944nnn/GSM944855/suppl/GSM944855_2564_6914_32321_Ctl-Van-4_Mouse430+2.CEL.gz","45101","8-10 weeks","vancomycin","male","A/J",NA,"4","0","hour 0","GSM944855","uninfected","vancomycin"
